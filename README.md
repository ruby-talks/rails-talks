# Rails-talks gem â€” now your rails repo and applications can talk

### This is beta now

This gem using base gem [talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks). You can use it if you want to hear when your rails repo and applications
tasks start and when they end.

Sponsored by [Evil Martians](http://evilmartians.com/).

## Why?

This idea appears on reddotrubyconf just as is :) I just thought about slow specs in rails and decided that I want to hear when they end.

## How?

This gem using gem `talks` and overwrites some of rails methods when you call `rails-talks` instead of `rake` from your command line.

### Using rails-talks

Now only `rails-talks test` function available. It runs `bundle exec rake test` with before and after `talks` hooks.

```bash
$ gem install rails-talks
$ rails-talks test # instead of just `bundle exec rake test`
```

You can work with `rails-talks test` just the same as with original `bundle exec rake test` - with some options and customizations:

`You are in .../rails/activesupport folder`
```bash
$ TEST_DIR=core_ext RUBYOPT=-W0 rails-talks test
# instead of
$ TEST_DIR=core_ext RUBYOPT=-W0 bundle exec rake test
```

How to customize voices for `talks` you can find in [talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks) repo.
